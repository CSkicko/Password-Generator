# Password-Generator

Password Generator has been created as part of my coding bootcamp in week 3

### User Story:
- AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
- I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
- SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
  
### Outcome:
The application is deemed to meet achieve the user story and acceptance criteria below. The front-end code developed incorporates:
- Javascript code to receive and validate inputs from the user to select password length (between 8 and 128 characters) and character types (at least one of lower case, upper case, numeric and special) 
- Javascript code to generate a random password based on the criteria selected and display this on the website
- Responsive design, to ensure the application can run in various devices

### The code presented in this repository is deemed to satisfy the following acceptance criteria:
- GIVEN I need a new, secure password
- WHEN I click the button to generate a password
- THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
- WHEN prompted for password criteria
- THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
- WHEN prompted for the length of the password
- THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
- WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
- THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
- WHEN I answer each prompt
- THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
- WHEN all prompts are answered
- THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
- WHEN the password is generated
- THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
